<p>Wait, you actually came here to see my website? damn. Well, I'm Viraj, a 19yr old that loves computers and Welcome to my little corner on the internet. Well, I'm a 2nd year college student. I watch a lot of anime, and listen to a lot of music. I love computers, like a lot and I love exploring new things about them :) Feel free to take a look around. There are some blogs to read up, an about page to know more about me and a contact page. So, take a look around and have fun!</p>

This is my very <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">minimal</a> website, a place of my own on the internet, my very little safe space where I am in control. A place where I can be myself. There are no restrictions, no secrets. Here, you can meet my true self and take a walk inside my head, and I will guide you through it!
